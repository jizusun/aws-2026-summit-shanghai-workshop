# Enterprise agent evaluation sample for Amazon Bedrock AgentCore

Scripts for building, deploying, and evaluating an enterprise HR Q&A agent built
with **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore**. This is the hands-on sample for the
"Eval-First: Building Enterprise Agents with AgentCore" workshop.

This folder is **self-contained** — it ships the CloudFormation template
(`cfn/workshop-infra.yaml`), the Knowledge Base tooling (`knowledge-base/`),
the HR Tools Lambda (`lambda/`), the Gateway tooling (`gateway/`), and both
custom evaluators (`evaluators/`). Running the scripts in order builds the
entire system from scratch in your own account.

> **Follow this README top to bottom.** Each step lists what it does, what it
> needs, and what it produces. Run the scripts **in the numbered order** — each
> one prints `Next: ...` pointing at the following step.

---

## 1. What this builds — and why

This sample is **eval-first**: the whole point is to stand up a realistic
enterprise agent and then **measure its quality with code-based evaluators**,
rather than eyeballing a few answers. The scripts build an HR Q&A agent
(Knowledge Base + Gateway tools + Memory on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore), run it to
produce traces, and then score those traces with two custom evaluators.

The two evaluators are the heart of the sample. They live in `evaluators/` and
are independent re-implementations of **published research methods** (not AWS
products), wired to run on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore:

- **`evaluators/thelma_eval/`** — single-turn **RAG quality**, based on **THELMA**.
  Runs at **TRACE** level. Decomposes one Q&A into `(question, retrieved sources,
  answer)` and scores **6 metrics** (0–1):
  **SP** = *Source Precision* (are retrieved docs relevant?),
  **SQC** = *Source Query Coverage* (do sources cover the question?),
  **RP** = *Response Precision* (is the answer on-topic?),
  **RQC** = *Response Query Coverage* (is the question fully answered?),
  **SD** = *Self-Distinctness* (no internal repetition?), and the primary metric
  **GR** = *Groundedness* (**is every sentence backed by a source? i.e. no
  hallucination**, pass threshold GR ≥ 0.7). Its real value is **diagnosis** — the
  *interplay* of these scores points at which RAG component to fix (retriever vs.
  prompt vs. source docs).
- **`evaluators/mtg_eval/`** — multi-turn **goal success**, based on **Mind the Goal**.
  Runs at **SESSION** level in three steps: **segment goals** (merge turns about the
  same thing), **judge success/failure** (a goal fails if any turn fails), then compute
  **GSR** = *Goal Success Rate* (successful goals ÷ total goals, pass threshold ≥ 80%)
  and attribute each failure via **RCOF** = *Root Cause of Failure* (7-category defect
  taxonomy). Answers "did the agent actually accomplish what the user came for?"

Both use judge model `us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0`. Each evaluator bundles its
algorithm, an **adapter layer** (ADOT span → evaluator input), and a Lambda
handler. **See [`evaluators/README.md`](evaluators/README.md) for the full metric
definitions, the THELMA diagnosis table, paper citations, and licensing.**

To make the evaluation meaningful, the Knowledge Base is seeded with
**intentionally noisy, cross-domain data** (see §6) — so the THELMA scores
surface real retrieval-quality problems instead of a clean toy result.

## 2. Prerequisites

These scripts build the **entire system from scratch in your own AWS account**.
Run them from an **EC2 instance in `us-west-2`**. You must run **every** step in
order, starting with the infrastructure stack (`00-deploy-infra.sh`).

### Tools

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| AWS account | Your own account, with an EC2 instance in **`us-west-2`** to run from |
| AWS CLI | Configured with credentials (`aws sts get-caller-identity` must succeed) |
| Node.js | v20+ |
| Python | 3.10+ (with `pip`) |
| AgentCore CLI | `npm i -g @aws/agentcore@preview` |

### IAM permissions

The identity you run as (e.g. the EC2 instance role, or your CLI user) needs
permissions to create and manage these services. **A read-only or narrowly
scoped role will fail.** The scripts touch:

`cloudformation`, `ec2` (VPC/subnets/NAT/SG), `s3` + `s3vectors`, `iam`
(create/attach roles & policies), `bedrock` + `bedrock-agent` +
`bedrock-agentcore-control`, `lambda`, `ssm`, `logs`, `xray`,
`application-signals`, `sts`.

If you control the account, attaching a broad policy (or `PowerUserAccess` +
`IAMFullAccess`) to the EC2 instance role is the simplest way to guarantee the
walkthrough completes. Tighten afterward as needed.

### Region

Set your region **once** in the shell you run everything from (all scripts
default to `us-west-2`; `us-east-1` and `us-east-2` are also supported by the
infra script):

```bash
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
cd static/scripts
chmod +x *.sh
```

---

## 3. Execution order at a glance

Approximate timings are from an end-to-end run on a blank account (us-west-2).
Total ≈ **25–30 minutes** of mostly-unattended waiting.

| # | Script | Phase | ~Time | What it creates / does |
|---|--------|-------|-------|------------------------|
| 1 | `00-setup.sh` | 0 | ~5s | Verify CLIs, create `~/workshop` dirs |
| 2 | `00-deploy-infra.sh` | 0 | ~5 min | **Required.** CloudFormation stack `workshop-infra`: VPC + subnets + NAT + SG, S3 data bucket + Access Point, EC2 |
| 3 | `01-create-kb.sh` | 0 | ~2 min | Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base (**Amazon S3 Vectors**) + HR policy docs + ingestion; writes KB ID to SSM |
| 4 | `02-create-gateway.sh` | 2 | ~30s | Deploy HR Tools **Lambda** + IAM role, then create the **Gateway** with the Lambda target |
| 5 | `03-configure-skills.sh` | 2 | ~5s | Write SKILL.md files and upload to S3 |
| 6 | `04-deploy.sh` | 2 | ~6 min | Create the **Harness**, attach Gateway tool + Skills, deploy (single-pass) |
| 7 | `05-setup-memory.sh` | 2 | ~1–2 min | Configure Memory **retrieval** on the Harness (waits for Runtime to be READY) |
| 8 | `06-test-conversation.sh` | 3 | ~20s | Run the first conversation (generates a trace) |
| 9 | `07-setup-eval-env.sh` | 4 | ~30s | Install `uv` + enable CloudWatch **Transaction Search** |
| 10 | `06-test-conversation.sh` *(again)* | 4 | ~20s | Regenerate a trace **after** Transaction Search is on |
| 11 | `08-create-evaluators.sh` | 4 | ~2 min | Register + deploy THELMA & Mind the Goal evaluators |
| 12 | `09-run-eval.sh` | 4 | ~2–3 min | Run the 3 golden questions, then evaluate them (Query + Response + scores) |
| 13 | `10-optimize-prompt.sh` | 5 | ~6–8 min | Optimize the System Prompt (anti-hallucination), redeploy, re-run the 3 questions, re-evaluate |
| 14 | `11-cost-latency.sh` | 6 | ~1 min | Cost & latency from the existing traces (per-answer token cost + end-to-end latency) |
| opt | `12-compare-models.sh` | optional | ~10–15 min | **Optional lab.** Swap to a cheaper model, re-run + re-evaluate, compare quality/cost/latency vs baseline (restores model after) |
| opt | `13-judge-stability.sh` | optional | ~5 min | **Optional lab.** Score the same trace N times to check the judge's repeatability |
| — | `99-cleanup.sh` | — | ~10–15 min | Tear everything down (reverse dep order; idempotent) |

---

## 4. Step-by-step

### Step 1 — `00-setup.sh`  *(Phase 0)*
Verifies `agentcore`, `node`, and `aws` are installed, prints your account/region,
and creates the `~/workshop/skills/...` directories.

```bash
./00-setup.sh
```

### Step 2 — `00-deploy-infra.sh`  *(Phase 0 — required)*
Deploys the `workshop-infra` CloudFormation stack: VPC, private subnets, NAT,
security group, the **data** S3 bucket + Access Point, and an EC2 work
environment (reachable via SSM). The template auto-selects AZs supported by
AgentCore. Takes ~5–8 minutes.

```bash
./00-deploy-infra.sh
```

> **Do not skip this.** Later steps depend on this stack's outputs:
> - `01-create-kb.sh` reads the **`DataBucketName`** output to know where to put
>   the Knowledge Base data source — it will **fail** if the stack doesn't exist.
> - `04-deploy.sh` uses the VPC/subnets/SG outputs to deploy the Harness in VPC
>   network mode.
>
> The script is idempotent: if the `workshop-infra` stack already exists, it
> skips creation and just prints the outputs.

### Step 3 — `01-create-kb.sh`  *(Phase 0)*
Generates 11 HR policy markdown documents, then creates an Amazon Bedrock
Knowledge Base backed by **Amazon S3 Vectors** (embedding model
`amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0`, 1024
dims), ingests the docs, and stores the KB ID in SSM at
`/app/hr/knowledge_base_id`. The Lambda in the next step reads it from there —
**no manual environment variables needed.**

> The HR policy bodies are **synthetic sample data** generated by
> `knowledge-base/generate_hr_docs.py`. Each document also appends a **FAQ section
> derived from the HR-MultiWOZ dataset** (arXiv:2402.01018, **Apache-2.0**;
> bundled in `knowledge-base/domain_faqs.py`). These FAQs are intentionally noisy
> and cross-domain — they simulate the "dirty" data found in real enterprise
> knowledge bases, so the evaluation can surface retrieval-quality
> problems. See **§6 Data sources & attribution**.
> The models referenced (`amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0`,
> `us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0`) are invoked as managed Amazon Bedrock models —
> no model weights are included or distributed.

```bash
./01-create-kb.sh
```

It prints the full KB details (ID, data location, vector store, embedding model)
on completion. The data bucket name is read automatically from the
`workshop-infra` stack output `DataBucketName` — **so step 2 must have completed
first**, otherwise this script aborts with
`Stack 'workshop-infra' has no DataBucketName output — is workshop-infra deployed?`

> **Cost note:** Amazon S3 Vectors is billed on storage + queries (no always-on
> cluster), so it is much cheaper than an always-on vector DB — but **still
> delete it when done** (see cleanup).

### Step 4 — `02-create-gateway.sh`  *(Phase 2)*
Two things in one step:
1. Packages and deploys the **HR Tools Lambda** (`hr-tools-handler`) and its IAM
   role (with permission to read the KB ID from SSM and query the Knowledge Base).
2. Creates the **Gateway** (MCP protocol, AWS_IAM auth) with the Lambda as its
   target, via `gateway/create_gateway.py`. The Gateway ARN is written to SSM at
   `/app/hr/gateway_arn`.

```bash
./02-create-gateway.sh
```

The Gateway exposes four tools: `retrieve_hr_policy`, `check_leave_balance`,
`submit_leave_request`, `query_salary_info`.

### Step 5 — `03-configure-skills.sh`  *(Phase 2)*
Writes the two SKILL.md files (`deep-policy-analysis`, `leave-calculator`) and
uploads them to the S3 data bucket under `skills/`. They get mounted into the
Harness in the next step (BYO Filesystem).

```bash
./03-configure-skills.sh
```

### Step 6 — `04-deploy.sh`  *(Phase 2)*
Creates the Harness project, attaches the **existing** Gateway by ARN (so no
duplicate Gateway is created — this is what makes deployment **single-pass**),
writes the system prompt, restricts `allowedTools` to `@hr-tools/*`, mounts the
Skills filesystem, and deploys.

```bash
./04-deploy.sh
```

Network mode: with the `workshop-infra` stack in place (step 2), the Harness
deploys in **VPC** mode using that stack's subnets/SG. (If the stack were
missing, the script would fall back to PUBLIC mode and skip Skills mounting — but
in this walkthrough step 2 is required, so you get VPC mode.)

### Step 7 — `05-setup-memory.sh`  *(Phase 2)*
Configures Memory **retrieval** on the deployed Harness so every invoke
automatically pulls the user's preferences and facts from Memory and injects
them into context.

```bash
./05-setup-memory.sh
```

> Note: `04-deploy.sh` already *creates* the Memory resource
> (`--memory longAndShortTerm`). This step wires up automatic *retrieval*
> per-invoke — they are not the same thing.

### Step 8 — `06-test-conversation.sh`  *(Phase 3)*
Runs the first conversation (asks about annual-leave policy) using a fresh
session ID and `actor-id employee-001`. The answer is intentionally generic at
this point — the Agent doesn't know your tenure or department yet. This also
produces the first **trace**.

```bash
./06-test-conversation.sh
```

---

### Step 9 — `07-setup-eval-env.sh`  *(Phase 4 pre)*
Installs `uv` (required to package evaluator Python dependencies) and enables
**CloudWatch Transaction Search**, so the Agent's OTel trace spans land in
CloudWatch where the evaluation service can read them.

```bash
./07-setup-eval-env.sh
```

> If the script tells you to, add `uv` to your PATH:
> ```bash
> export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
> ```

### Step 10 — `06-test-conversation.sh` *(run again)*  *(Phase 4)*
Transaction Search only captures spans created **after** it was enabled. Re-run
the conversation to generate a trace the evaluators can read:

```bash
./06-test-conversation.sh
```

### Step 11 — `08-create-evaluators.sh`  *(Phase 4)*
Registers and deploys the two custom code-based evaluators, then grants their
execution roles Bedrock invoke permission (needed for the LLM-judge):
- `thelma_rag_quality` — **TRACE** level, RAG 6-metric quality, primary score = **Groundedness**
- `mtg_goal_success` — **SESSION** level, **Goal Success Rate (GSR)** + failure attribution (**RCOF**)

See [`evaluators/README.md`](evaluators/README.md) for what each metric means.

```bash
./08-create-evaluators.sh
```

### Step 12 — `09-run-eval.sh`  *(Phase 4)*
By default, runs the **3 golden questions** (performance review / benefits / sick
leave) to produce traces, waits for them to index, then evaluates those traces and
prints, for each: the **Query**, a truncated **Response**, and the **score** (THELMA
6-metric breakdown + diagnosis, and Mind the Goal GSR + RCOF).

```bash
./09-run-eval.sh                        # run the 3 golden questions, then evaluate them (both evaluators)
./09-run-eval.sh --eval-only [N]        # skip conversations; evaluate the N most recent retrieval traces (default 3)
./09-run-eval.sh <trace-id>             # THELMA only, on one trace
./09-run-eval.sh <session-id> session   # Mind the Goal only, on one session
```

### Step 13 — `10-optimize-prompt.sh`  *(Phase 5)*
Closes the ADLC loop. Acting on the Phase 4 diagnosis (`SQC↓ RQC↑ GR↓` / `RP↓` →
Prompt), it: (1) writes an optimized System Prompt with **anti-hallucination
constraints** ("answer strictly from retrieved content / ignore irrelevant chunks /
be concise"), (2) `agentcore deploy` to redeploy, (3) re-asks the **same 3 golden
questions** (v2 sessions), and (4) re-evaluates the new traces (reuses
`09-run-eval.sh --eval-only`).

```bash
./10-optimize-prompt.sh
```

Compare against the pre-optimization scores: for questions where retrieval is good
(performance review, benefits), grounding/precision improve; the sick-leave question
(SP2≈0, retrieval failure) stays Fail — a prompt change can't fix it. That contrast
**confirms the THELMA diagnosis**: it distinguishes "fix the Prompt" from "fix
retrieval."

> The optimized prompt is in **Chinese** (matching the Chinese KB documents). With
> the prompt language aligned to the KB, the anti-hallucination constraints land
> most effectively. Note that LLM-as-judge scores fluctuate between runs — read the
> trend and the diagnosis, not a single absolute number.

### Step 14 — `11-cost-latency.sh`  *(Phase 6)*
Delivers the "responsiveness" and "cost" sides of the decision-first scorecard.
Reads the **existing** golden-set traces from `aws/spans` (the same data §6.1
audits — **no new resources**), and for each conversation computes end-to-end
latency, input/output tokens, and per-answer cost at Nova 2 Lite pricing.

```bash
./11-cost-latency.sh            # most recent N traces with retrieval
./11-cost-latency.sh <trace-id> # a single trace
```

> Prices (`PRICE_IN` / `PRICE_OUT`, $/1M tokens) and the span token-field names
> are best confirmed on a live run — see the hints the script prints. Override
> prices with `PRICE_IN=... PRICE_OUT=... ./11-cost-latency.sh`.

---

## Optional labs — `12` / `13`

These are **optional extensions** (mapped to content `085_optional_labs/`). They
reuse the already-deployed Agent and evaluators, so **run them before
`99-cleanup.sh`**. They're outside the ~2-hour main line.

### `12-compare-models.sh` — multi-model comparison
Answers "can a cheaper model still pass eval?" Non-destructively swaps the model
ID in `harness.json`, redeploys, re-runs the 3 golden questions + THELMA/MtG +
cost/latency, then **restores the baseline model** (via an exit trap — the
evaluators are never deleted). Compare the output against the Phase 4 baseline.

```bash
./12-compare-models.sh                          # default compare model = Nova Micro
./12-compare-models.sh us.amazon.nova-micro-v1:0
```

> Assumes the model ID lives in `app/hrassistant/harness.json` (it checks and
> aborts cleanly if not found). Confirm on a test env first.

### `13-judge-stability.sh` — judge repeatability
Answers "is the AI judge itself trustworthy?" Scores the **same trace** N times
with THELMA and reports the spread (mean / std / range). Small models like
Nova 2 Lite may jitter more — that's the point. For production, the recommended
parallel is **human-sample calibration** (TPR/TNR against labeled data).

```bash
./13-judge-stability.sh                  # most recent retrieval trace, 3 runs
./13-judge-stability.sh <trace-id> 5     # specific trace, 5 runs
```

---

## 5. Cleanup — `99-cleanup.sh`

**Always run this after the workshop** to avoid ongoing charges (Knowledge Base,
Lambdas, NAT gateway, etc.).

```bash
./99-cleanup.sh
```

The script tears everything down. If the stack delete is blocked by managed ENIs,
it falls back to a retained-resource delete so the stack still completes; AWS
reclaims the leftover VPC networking on its own (no charge, no action needed).
The script is idempotent — re-running is safe.

---

## 6. Data sources & attribution

The Knowledge Base documents combine two sources:

- **HR policy bodies** — synthetic sample content authored for this workshop
  (`knowledge-base/generate_hr_docs.py`).
- **FAQ sections** — derived from the **HR-MultiWOZ** dataset and bundled in
  `knowledge-base/domain_faqs.py`. These are intentionally noisy/cross-domain to
  demonstrate the eval-first optimization loop.
